This repository contains Matlab scripts for simulating a Schlieren 4-f system and a Shadowgraphy setup.
Everything is based on wave optics and therefore considers diffraction effects of both the target and the razor blade.
The full Bachelor's Thesis with more theoretical background can be found [here](https://felix.sumpi.org/bachelor_thesis_felix_wechsler_physics.pdf).


## Schlieren Setup
The main script for that is `schlieren.m`. After line 38 one can decide which target is used.

## Shadowgraphy Setup
The main script for that is `shadowgraphy.m`. After line 37 one can decide which target is used.
